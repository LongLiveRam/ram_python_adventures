# The program must have a pre-defined list of words to choose from.
# It should randomly select one word from this list for the user to guess.
# The game should have a set number of allowed incorrect guesses (e.g., 6).
# The program must track the letters the user has already guessed.
# After each guess, the game must display the state of the word, showing correctly guessed letters and blanks for the unguessed ones.
# The user should be prompted to enter a single letter.
# The program must handle cases where the user enters a non-letter, a letter they've already guessed, or more than one letter.
# The game should continue in a loop until the user either guesses the full word or runs out of guesses.
# At the end, the program should announce whether the user won or lost.
